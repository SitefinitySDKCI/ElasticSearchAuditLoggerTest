[![Build Status](http://sdk-jenkins-ci.cloudapp.net/buildStatus/icon?job=Telerik.Sitefinity.ElasticSearchAuditLogger.CI)](http://sdk-jenkins-ci.cloudapp.net/job/Telerik.Sitefinity.ElasticSearchAuditLogger.CI/)

**ElasticSearchAuditModule** is a Sitefinity module used in conjunction with the [Audit Trail module](http://www.sitefinity.com/documentation/documentationarticles/audit-trail). When you activate both modules, the site administrator can monitor the actions performed by the users and also the system processes by using [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/ "Kibana"). Actions are logged by *Type*, *Name*, *TimeStamp*, user performing the actions, user affected by the action, and others. 

Predefined dashboards
----------

Sitefinity has some predefined dashboards to help you start with the monitoring process. There are predefined dashboards for user permissions, content changes, and backend access. You can find the predefined dashboards in the *Dashboards* folder.
